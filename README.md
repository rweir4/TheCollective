## The Collective

The Collective is inspired by Pinterest, using the idea of collecting images so that you can save and share them with those you follow or that follow you.

To get started, run bundle exec rails db:setup, bundle exec rails db:seed, and npm install.

This is the welcome page:

There is a demo login for a seeded account.

Implementing the upload of images for items took the use of the Paperclip gem. You can upload via file or url (will upload image of this in the future. Currently down)

Search, notifications, and messaging are features to come.
